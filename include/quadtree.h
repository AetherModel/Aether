/**************************************************************
 * \class Quadtree
 *
 * \brief Defines the quadtree for blocks 
 * 
 * Aether is logically an i, j, k grid structure.  Aether does domain
 * decomposition on the (i, j) coordinates and each processor works on
 * the full domain of the k dimension.  (e.g., nn spherical
 * coordinates, i = longitude, j = latitude, and k = altitude.)  The
 * quadtree takes the (i, j) dimensions and makes blocks out of them.
 * 
 * In the quadtree there are a number of root nodes, which are then
 * divided into 2 x 2 blocks.  Each of those can then be subdivided
 * into 2 x 2 blocks.  Each block resides on a separate processor.
 * The depth of the tree is then related to the number of processors
 * as N_roots * 4 ^ Depth, where Depth = 0 are the root nodes alone.
 *
 * For the sphere, N_roots = 1, while for the cubesphere N_roots = 6.
 *
 * In the logical (i, j) block, left/right is i, which down/up is j.
 * conventions:
 * du = down / up
 * lr = left / right
