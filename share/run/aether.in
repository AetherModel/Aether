This is a sample input file for the Aether model.

Some things to know about this:

1. The code ignores all lines until it finds a hashtag (#) with a
command after it (#command).

2. After the #command, there are inputs that have to be in a specific
format. You can read the manual to see all of the commands and the
format of the command.

3. Most commands have defaults. If you don't want to change the default,
you don't have to include the command.

4. If there are more than two spaces in a line, the code ignores
everything after those two spaces.  That way you can put comments on
the lines.

5. Everything is turned into lower case, so use whatever case you
want.

6. We are working on making things so that you can enter them as comma
separated values or a row of values (e.g., times can be year, month,
day, etc, or year\n month\n day\n etc...)
