This is the input file for the planet Acheron.  It is basically
meant to be an experimental planet.  As a starting point,
Acheron will be a single neutral species (O) and
a single ion species (O+) planet.

The base altitude of Acheron is 1000 km.

name is the character string that identifies the species

O(3P) is the base state of neutral atomic oxygen and is called O.

Vibration is the degrees of freedom for the atom/molecule

thermal conduction is typically:
Lambda = (N1 * A1 * T^c1 + N2 * A2 * T^c2 + ... ) / (N1+N2+...)
thermal_cond is the A for the particular species
thermal_exp is the c for the particular species

mass is in amu

advect is whether the species is advected or not

BC is a density that is used in the lowest boundary cell if you
  want a constant boundary condition.
  Set to a real value to use this.
  Set to a negative number if you want to use a different BC.
  In this example file, the values are from 96.87 km Jan 1, 2013
  O_1D is made up.


#NEUTRALS
name, mass, vibration, thermal_cond, thermal_exp, advect, BC
O, 16, 5, 5.6e-4, 0.69, 1, 5.0e17


Here we can input a temperature profile for the initial condition:
  - below the lowest altitude, it will use the lowest alt
  - above the highest alt, it will use the highest alt
  - in between, linear interpolation
  - altitudes in km

#TEMPERATURE
alt, temp
1000.0, 200.0
1500.0, 1000.0
2000.0, 1000.0

O+ is O+(4S) is the base state of O+, but is just called O+
O+ has excited states of O+(2D) and O+(2P).

#IONS
name, mass, charge, advect
O+, 16, 1, 1
