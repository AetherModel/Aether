# Temporary Aether Documentation

As the [full Aether
documentation](https://aetherdocumentation.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html)
is still in [development](https://github.com/AetherModel/AetherDocumentation),
this collection of Markdown files may provide more information on the use of the
Aether model.

Users are encouraged to begin with the [README](../README.md) at the root of the
repository first, then consult the documents here for further assistance. While
effort was devoted to covering as much as possible regarding setup, it is
inevitable that there will be gaps in the documentation. Do not hesitate to
file an Issue on the Aether repository to request the documentation be filled
in.
