# Aether reporting guidelines

Aether is a NSF/NASA funded project that involves several US academic and
federal institutions, whose goal is to create an extremely flexible
community-based ionosphere-thermosphere model.  Because community is at the
heart of the Aether project, all members are expected to treat all other
members with respect and courtesy.  If you feel that the Code of Conduct was
violated in an Aether event or online space (either towards yourself or towards
another person), please follow these guidelines when reporting it to the
Aether Core Team.
